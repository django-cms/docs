   * Select "Manage versions..."

   or

   * Preview or edit the page the versions of which you want to manage.

   * Created and modified dates
   * Title and language
   * Username of the author
   * Status: Draft, Published, Unpublished, and Archived
   * Action buttons

3. **Acting upon versions:**
   Actions differ by status of the version. They include

   * Edit (pencil): Edit this version (draft) or create a new draft from this version (published)
   * Archive: Mark this draft as archived for later usage
   * Revert: Create new draft from this archived or unpublished version
   * Publish: Publish this draft
   * Unpublish: Make this published version unavailable
   * Delete: Delete this draft version
   * View: Preview this version

4. **Comparing two versions:**

   * Select exactly two versions to compare by checking the box on their left side
   * From the pull-down menu marked ``-------`` select "Compare versions"
   * Click "Go"

.. note::

  Only draft versions can be deleted. Outdated versions are kept on purpose.

Managing versions in Django CMS allows to unterstand the history of the page content. Drafts can be archived for later reuse. All versions currently public or once public are marked "published" or "unpublished", respectively. The content of versions can be compared with each other.
