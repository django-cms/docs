Placeholders
############

In Django CMS, placeholders are special markers within templates that define regions where content can be edited and managed by content editors. These placeholders act as slots or containers within a template where various types of content can be added, modified, and rearranged through django CMS' frontend editor and its structure board.

Here's how placeholders work:

1. **Defined Areas in a page:** Designers identify specific areas within their HTML templates where content can be dynamically inserted. Editors can access these defined placeholders and add or edit content directly through the user-friendly frontend editing interface without needing to touch the underlying code. Pages can be rendered using different templates.
2. **Content Manipulation:** Editors interact with placeholders to add various types of content elements or plugins (such as text, images, videos, forms, etc.) to these designated areas. They can modify existing content, rearrange elements, or remove content as needed.
3. **Flexibility and Customization:** Django CMS allows for the creation of custom plugins that can be inserted into placeholders. These plugins offer a wide range of functionalities and content types, giving content editors the flexibility to create diverse and engaging web pages without requiring developer intervention for each content update.

Ultimately, placeholders in Django CMS facilitate a clear separation between the presentation layer (templates) and the content, enabling content editors to manage and update website content easily without needing extensive technical knowledge or modifying the underlying code.
