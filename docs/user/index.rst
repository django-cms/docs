          This is a new section in the django CMS documentation, and a priority
          for the project. If you'd like to contribute to it, we'd love to hear
          from you - join us on `our friendly Slack group

Introduction
############

This is a user guide for django CMS. The intended audience for this guide are content creators and site administrators.

Django CMS sites are highly customisable and varied. The examples here follow the `quickstart project from Github <https://github.com/django-cms/quickstart>`_. This provides certain features, which are entirely optional for your own site, and the features provided in the quickstart are used in this guide to demonstrate how django CMS can be used.

The origin of this document is a guide provided by `Kapt.mobi <https://support.kapt.mobi/index.php/docs/kapt-doc/>`_. It has been translated from the native French and extended.
