**********
Philosophy
**********

The design philosophy of django-cms is to solve something complex with many simple things.

The core of django-cms is designed to be simple and integrate with simple packages to create 
complex applications. For example, you may add ``djangocms-versioning`` to manage versions 
of your content, ``djangocms-moderation`` to define workflows for how content moves from 
authoring to being published.

********
Overview
********

django CMS is a modern web publishing platform built with `Django`_, the web application framework "for
perfectionists with deadlines".

django CMS offers out-of-the-box support for the common features you'd expect
from a CMS, but can also be easily customised and extended by developers to
create a site that is tailored to their precise needs.

***************
Why django CMS?
***************

django CMS is a well-tested CMS platform that powers sites both large and
small. Here are a few of the key features:

* robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites
* front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface
* support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features.
* a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the
  fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface

* ...and much more

There are other capable Django-based CMS platforms but here's why you should
consider django CMS:

* thorough documentation
* easy and comprehensive integration into existing projects - django CMS isn't a monolithic application
* a healthy, active and supportive developer community
* a strong culture of good code, including an emphasis on automated testing
