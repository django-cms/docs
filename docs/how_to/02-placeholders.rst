How to use placeholders outside the CMS
#######################################

Placeholders are special model fields that django CMS uses to render
user-editable content (plugins) in templates. That is, it's the place where a
user can add text, video or any other plugin to a webpage, using the same
frontend editing as the CMS pages.

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Placeholders can be viewed as containers for :class:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` instances, and
can be used outside the CMS in custom applications using the
:class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField`.

By defining a :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField` on a
custom model you can take advantage of the full power of :class:`~cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin` in one or more placholders.


.. warning::

    Django CMS 3.x used a different way of integrating placeholders. It's ``PlaceholderField("slot_name")`` needs to be changed into a ``PlaceholderRelationField`` (available since django CMS 4.x).

***********
Get started
***********

You need to define a :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField` on the model you would like to
use::

    from django.db import models
    from cms.models.fields import PlaceholderRelationField
    from cms.utils.placeholder import get_placeholder_from_slot

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # your fields
        placeholders = PlaceholderRelationField()

        @cached_property
        def my_placeholder(self):
            return get_placeholder_from_slot(self.placeholders, "my_placeholder")

        # your methods


The :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField` can reference more than one field. It is customary to add (cached) properties to the model referring to specific placeholders. The utility function :func:`~cms.utils.placeholder.get_placeholder_from_slot` retrieves a placeholder object based on its slot name.

The ``slot`` is used in templates, to determine where the placeholder's plugins should appear
in the page, and in the placeholder configuration :setting:`CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF`, which determines
which plugins may be inserted into this placeholder.

.. note::

    If you add a PlaceholderRelationField to an existing model, you'll be able to see
    the placeholder in the frontend editor only after saving the relevant instance.

Admin Integration
=================

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Since django CMS version 4 :class:`~cms.admin.placeholderadmin.PlaceholderAdminMixin` is not required any more. For now, it still exists as an empty mixin but will be removed in a future version.


I18N Placeholders
=================

Placeholders and plugins within them support multiple languages out of the box.

If you need other fields translated as well, django CMS has support for `django-hvad`_. If you use
a ``TranslatableModel`` model be sure to **not** include the placeholder fields amongst the
translated fields::

    class MultilingualExample1(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            title=models.CharField('title', max_length=255),
            description=models.CharField('description', max_length=255),
        )
        placeholders = PlaceholderRelationField()

        @cached_property
        def placeholder_1(self):
            return get_placeholder_from_slot(self.placeholders, "placeholder_1")

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title


Templates
=========

To render the placeholder in a template you use the :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag from the
:mod:`~cms.templatetags.cms_tags` template tag library:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder "640" %}

The :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag takes the following parameters:

* :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderField` instance
* ``width`` parameter for context sensitive plugins (optional)
* ``language`` keyword plus ``language-code`` string to render content in the
  specified language (optional)

The view in which you render your placeholder field must return the
:class:`request <django.http.HttpRequest>` object in the context. This is
typically achieved in Django applications by using :class:`~django.template.RequestContext`::

    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render

    def my_model_detail(request, id):
        object = get_object_or_404(MyModel, id=id)
        return render(request, 'my_model_detail.html', {
            'object': object,
        })

If you want to render plugins from a specific language, you can use the tag
like this:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load cms_tags %}

    {% render_placeholder mymodel_instance.my_placeholder language 'en' %}

*******************************
Adding content to a placeholder
*******************************

Placeholders can be edited from the frontend by visiting the page displaying your model (where you
put the :ttag:`render_placeholder` tag), then appending ``?toolbar_on`` to the page's URL.

This will make the frontend editor top banner appear (and if necessary will require you to login).

Once in frontend editing mode, the interface for your application's ``PlaceholderFields`` will work
in much the same way as it does for CMS Pages, with a switch for Structure and Content modes and so
on.

There is no automatic draft/live functionality for general Django models, so content is updated
instantly whenever you add/edit them.

.. _placeholder_object_permissions:

Permissions
===========

To be able to edit a placeholder user must be a ``staff`` member and needs either edit permissions
on the model that contains the :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField`, or permissions for
that specific instance of that model. Required permissions for edit actions are:

* to ``add``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` permission on related Model or instance.
* to ``change``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` permission on related Model or instance.
* to ``delete``: require ``add`` **or** ``change`` **or** ``delete`` permission on related Model
  or instance.

With this logic, an user who can ``change`` a Model's instance but can not ``add`` a new
Model's instance will be able to add some placeholders or plugins to existing Model's instances.

Model permissions are usually added through the default Django ``auth`` application and its admin
interface. Object-level permission can be handled by writing a custom authentication backend as
described in `django docs
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/customizing/#handling-object-permissions>`_

For example, if there is a ``UserProfile`` model that contains a ``PlaceholderRelationField`` then the
custom backend can refer to a ``has_perm`` method (on the model) that grants all rights to current
user only based on the user's ``UserProfile`` object::

    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        if not user_obj.is_staff:
            return False
        if isinstance(obj, UserProfile):
            if user_obj.get_profile()==obj:
                return True
        return False
