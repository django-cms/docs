Contribute to django CMS
##################################

As an open source project, django CMS is only as strong as its community.
Without the donation of time and skill of our contributors and the financial
support of our `association members <https://www.django-cms.org/en/our-members/>`_
it would not be possible to maintain the django CMS project.
The community is the backbone of django CMS.

Our contributors come from all over the world and have different
levels of skills and expertise. No matter if you are a developer, usability
enthusiast, designer or copywriter. Young or old. Experienced or inexperienced.
Every contribution, however small, is valued.

You donâ€™t need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all you need
is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the contribution guidelines.

Open source contribution can include taking part in discussions,
filing bug reports, proposing improvements, contributing code or writing documentation.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to
the success of the django CMS project.

All activity in the community is governed by our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.

******************************************
3 Reasons Why You Should Contribute
******************************************


1. Boost your reputation
=========================
Through your involvement as a contributor, other people become aware of your work.
In this way, you make a name for yourself in the community and your reputation grows. This
can also help you in your professional career. Add your contribution to your resume or LinkedIn profile.

2. Find a mentor and improve your skills
==================================================
When you join a workgroup, you will receive guidance and support from the workgroup leader.
Our working group leaders are professionals in their field and often in leading positions in
their respective companies. Take advantage of this unique opportunity for personal development!

3. Meet new people and increase your network
==================================================
Let's face it: Ultimately, it's the people who bring the django CMS project to life and fill it with joy.
Through your involvement, you'll meet new people and maybe even make new friends. As a community,
it's important to us to create a pleasant atmosphere where everyone feels welcome!

******************************************
Are you new to django CMS?
******************************************

If you are new to django CMS, then we recommend you to first familiarize yourself with the CMS
and start with the `install <https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction/01-install.html>`_ section.
After that, you can have a go at issues on Github that are marked `Good first issue <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/labels/good%20first%20issues>`_.
These issues are especially good if you're just starting out but still want to contribute.
Beginners can also contribute to the project, for example by helping to improve the documentation,
or other tasks, such as writing a blog article series about your journey of learning django CMS
(See `community tasks <https://www.django-cms.org/en/community-tasks/>`_).
After you have acquainted yourself with django CMS and maybe already created your first website with it,
you should start looking at contributing to the django CMS codebase.

**********************************************************
Don't want to contribute alone? Join a working group
**********************************************************

Most participation in the django CMS is organized through work groups. These are small,
independent groups of volunteers who have come together to work on a project.

It is entirely up to you whether you want to join such a `work group <https://www.django-cms.org/en/join-work-group/>`_
and join other django CMS enthusiasts or if you want to work on topics on your own.
By the way, you can also create your own work group. Find out more `here <https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/work%20contribution/work%20groups.md>`_.

Are you interested in knowledge sharing and improving your skills? Then a workgroup might be
the right choice for you. Would you rather decide for yourself when and what you work on? Then you
can choose a task from our community tasks list or contribute directly on Github
by answering issues or create Pull Requests.
